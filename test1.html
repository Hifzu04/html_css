        <p>The <b>Solar System<sup>[c]</sup></b> is the gravitationally(F = K M<sup>2</sup><sub>/R<sup>2</sup></sub>)
            bound system
            of the Sun and the objects
            that orbit it. The largest of such objects are the eight planets, in order from
            he Sun: four terrestrial planets named Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, two gas giants named Jupiter
            and Saturn, and two ice giants named Uranus and Neptune. The terrestrial planets have a definite surface
            and are mostly made of rock and metal. The gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and helium, while the ice
            giants
            are mostly made of 'volatile' substances such as water,(H<sub>2</sub>O) ammonia, and
            methane.(CH<sub>4</sub>)
            In some texts, these terrestrial and giant planets
            are called the inner Solar System and outer Solar System planets respectively.</p>

        <h2>Formation and evolution</h2>
        <p>The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large
            molecular cloud.[e] </p>
        <h2>Structure and composition
        </h2>
        <P> The word solar means "pertaining to the <span class="terrestrial">sun</span>", which is derived from the
            Latin
            word sol, meaning Sun.[25] The Sun is the dominant gravitational member of the <span
                class="terrestrial">solar system</span>
            solated, gravitationally bound orbits around the Sun.</P>
        <h3><b>orbits</b></h3>
        <p>The planets and other large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the
            ecliptic. Smaller icy objects such as comets
            frequently orbit at significantly greater angles to this plane.[</p>
        <h2>poem on solar system </h2>
        <P>
            Amidst the cosmic dance, a system so <b>bright</b>,<br>
            Planets and stars, in endless <b>flight,</b><br>
            Around the sun, they gracefully <b>roam,</b><br>
            Our solar symphony, a celestial <b>home.</b><br>
        </P>
